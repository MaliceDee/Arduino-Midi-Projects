# Arduino-Midi-Projects
This is a collective of miscelaneous arduino-midi projects I'm working on and learning from in my pursuit to design and create unique, expressive midi controllers.
I credit a lot of my influence to mechanical engineer/ artist Tristian Shone(Author&Punisher) and his Drone Machines.
